Final Project of Exploratory Data Analysis Course(Data Science)

Questions
You must address the following questions and tasks in your exploratory analysis. For each question/task you will need to make a single plot. Unless specified, you can use any plotting system in R to make your plot.
1. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.:

	Answer: The Total Emissions have decreased in the US during the years.

2. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (fips == "24510") from 1999 to 2008? Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.

	Answer: The Total Emissions have decreased in the US during the years in Baltimore city, except for an increase in 2005.

3. Of the four types of sources indicated by the  type(point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City (fips == "24510") ? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question.

	Answer: The Total Emissions from all the 4 sources decreased in the US during the years in Baltimore city, except for the point
		source which shows an increase upto 2005 and then decrease.

4. Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999–2008?

	Answer: The Total Coal Emissions have decreased in the US during the years.

5. How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City(fips == "24510")?

	Answer: The MotorVehicle Emissions have decreased in the US during the years.

6. Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City (fips == "24510") with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (fips == "06037"). Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?

	Answer: The MotorVehicle Emissions in Baltimore is very low compared to California.
		The trend shows that in Baltimore there is a slight decreasing trend whereas in California
		the Motor Vehicle Emissions decreased upto 2005 and  then increased.
